Overview
Bootstrap is a boilerplate for HTML and CSS. CSS frameworks allow develeopers to quickly style a web application so we can focus on bootstrapping it, ie: building and deploying the business logic. Most CSS frameworks handle the more challenging aspects of CSS for us, such as floats and media queries. Another benefit of using CSS frameworks is ensuring consistency across applications. Depending the developer's career trajectory, they may be required to maintain multiple web applications, and CSS can get unruly very quickly. As applications scale, ease of maintenance and organization of the codebase becomes very important.

Bootstrap was one of the first CSS frameworks and is, at the time of this writing, the most widely used in production. It was created by the developers at Twitter for the reasons discussed above and released as an open source project in 2011, meaning anyone could then use Bootstrap in their applications for free. There are now dozens of CSS frameworks to choose from, but learning Bootstrap will set you up to quickly adapt to almost any CSS framework as they tend to share the same underlying concept of a grid system structured by rows and columns.
